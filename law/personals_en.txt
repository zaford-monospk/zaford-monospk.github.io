Where applicable, we ask for your consent on the site.</p> <p><a href=\"https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en\">Google Analytics for visitor and usage analytics</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en\">Google Ads for ad targeting, analytics and reporting</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/privacy/center/\">Facebook Pixel for marketing</a></p> <p>lease note that above 3rd parties are not necessarily being used at all sites, or on all market areas.</p> <h3>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR DATA</h3> <h4>Security Safeguards.</h4> <p>In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and implementing administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.</p> <h4>Data retention.</h4> <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. We may for example periodically de-identify unused game accounts, and we may regularly review and de-identify unnecessary data.<br />Note that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p> <h3>CHILDREN</h3> <p>Protecting children&rsquo;s privacy online is very important to us. Generally, our Services are not directed to children under 13 (or other age as required by local law), and the Services do not knowingly collect personal data from children, except as described in the following paragraph.</p> <p>For games that are not directed at children but nonetheless may appeal to them, we take additional steps to limit access to these Services based on the player&rsquo;s age. For these Services, when a player indicates they are under 13 (or the applicable age in their territory), we will limit their access to certain features, such as social media and chat features, as well as certain types of notification alerts. We also limit the processing of personal data to only what is necessary to support the internal operations of our Services.</p> <p>Please note that for some of our Services we may use a higher age limit (such as 16) than described in the above two paragraphs. We do this to provide a safe game experience for our players and to protect Young Players.</p> <p>If you are a parent or guardian and wish to review personal data collected from your child, or have that information modified or deleted, you may contact us as described above. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal data contrary to the above, we will delete any personal data we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child&rsquo;s account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.</p> <p />"
