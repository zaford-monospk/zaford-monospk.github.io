Disputes include any claims of any kind, including but not limited to legal, equitable, or statutory claims, arising at any time, including before we entered into this agreement. Processes for dispute resolution will apply even if you stop using your Account, delete your Account, or stop using the Service.</p> <p>Sections 8.1 to 8.7 apply to you if you are a resident of the United States or Canada. They do not apply to you if you are a resident of any other country.</p> <h4>8.1. Informal Dispute Resolution</h4> <p>You must attempt to resolve the Dispute directly with &ldquo;m50k&rdquo; informally for at least 30 days before initiating an arbitration proceeding. The informal dispute resolution process begins when you provide Notice of Dispute to &ldquo;m50k&rdquo; at admin@m50k.com.</p> <h4>8.2. Arbitration&nbsp;</h4> <p>You and &quot;m50k&quot; agree to resolve any disputes exclusively in final and binding individual arbitration as follows:</p> <p>Either you or &quot;m50k&quot; may choose to submit any dispute for resolution exclusively by final and binding arbitration unless the claim is within the exceptions described below. These arbitration proceedings shall be conducted on an individual basis only, meaning the dispute is solely between you and &quot;m50k&quot;. If you or &quot;m50k&quot; brings a claim in court that can be resolved by arbitration under this section, then either party can ask the court to order the parties to resolve the claim by arbitration. The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority to decide whether any portion of Section 8 (&ldquo;Dispute Resolution&rdquo;) is valid or enforceable, or whether it applies to a claim.</p> <p>An arbitration proceeding will be held before a single neutral arbitrator. This means you and &quot;m50k&quot; agree to give up the right to resolve the dispute in a trial before a judge or jury. Arbitration has different rules than more formal lawsuits. For example, the ability to force the other side to share information may be more limited than the process called discovery in formal lawsuits. After the arbitrator decides the outcome, that decision will be final. You or &quot;m50k&quot; can ask the arbitrator to put a decision or award and the reasons for it in writing. Either of us can ask a court to confirm or enter the arbitrator&rsquo;s final decision or award, which will make it the same as a court judgment. You and &quot;m50k&quot; will generally not be able to change the outcome of arbitration through courts outside of very limited circumstances.</p> <h4>8.3. Arbitration Process</h4> <p>The arbitration will be run by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;). AAA&rsquo;s rules and procedures will be used for the arbitration, including the Consumer Arbitration Rules. But if there is a conflict between these Terms of Service and AAA&rsquo;s rules and procedures, then we will follow these Terms of Service. To review AAA&rsquo;s Rules or to start arbitration, you can go to <a href=\"https://adr.org/\">AAA&rsquo;s website</a>. If either of us decides to start arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.</p> <p>The fees for arbitration will be determined by AAA&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules. If the arbitrator decides that those fees are excessive, &quot;m50k&quot; will pay the fees. Each side will pay their own attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs unless the claims allow the prevailing party to recover attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs, in which case the arbitrator may award them under the AAA Rules or applicable law.
